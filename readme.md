# Ginyuu - Simple Digital Products Shop

This is my small project — an template for online shop for digital products like UI kits, icons, templates etc.  
I built it mostly to practice HTML, CSS, JavaScript and to learn how a e-commerce website flow could look like.

Its compact and simple complete with backend and database.

## What pages are included

- Home page (landing)
- Showcase (some fake project examples)
- Products list (browse items)
- Product detail modal (click "Buy Now")
- Register page
- Login page
- Checkout page (with fake verification modal)
- Profile page (with fake purchases & settings)

## Tech stack (very basic)

- HTML
- CSS (just plain CSS, no framework)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Some Unsplash images for placeholders
- postgresql
- express.js
- bun

## How it looks

Mostly indigo/purple colors (#6366f1), rounded corners, some hover effects, mobile responsive.

## How to run it locally
1. bun install
2. bun run dev
3. open localhost:3100/pages/ in browser

## What works ?

- Looks okay on desktop & mobile  
- modals (product detail, payment verification)  
- tabs on profile  
- Password show/hide on login/register (Frontend and backend)  
- real login/register (Frontend and backend)  
- No real payment  
- saving data (data saved in database or local storage)  
- Cart is missing (will be make soon)



## Plans (if I continue)

- Add cart page adn functionality
- Make product detail 
- Add dark mode toggle
- Maybe connect to real payment gateway
- Add some animation library (maybe GSAP or just framer-motion if I switch to React)

## License

Do whatever you want with it 😄  
But please don't sell it as your own commercial template haha
